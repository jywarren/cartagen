Cartagen is a vector-based, client-side framework for rendering maps in native HTML 5. Maps are styled in GSS, a cascading stylesheet specification for geospatial information – a decision which leverages literacy in CSS to make map styling more accessible. 

http://cartagen.org is a demonstration of the latest release of Cartagen. Test it out, visit places, and create your own maps!

What to install
=================================================

The client edition is the simplest version of Cartagen, and the easiest to get started with – you don’t need a web server to run it. However, you must provide it with static data or every location you want it to load - it cannot dynamically fetch data from a server. Download a copy from: http://github.com/jywarren/cartagen/downloads
